# Kyopoulou

## Bulgarian Eggplant and Pepper Dip

### Ingredients

* 3 eggplants
* 3-4 ripe tomatoes\
(note: there is an argument amongst families about whether there should be tomatoes in kyopoulou)
* 5 peppers (a mix of red and green bell is best here, in my opinion)
* 5 cloves of garlic
* 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* &frac12; tsp salt
* Some black pepper
* Handful of Italian parsley leaves, roughly chopped

### Instructions

1. Roast the vegetables &mdash; grilling over a hot fire is the best way to do it.
    * Grill the eggplant over medium heat until tender
    * Grill the peppers over high heat until the skins are blackened all over
    * Briefly char the tomatoes.
2. Put the eggplant and peppers in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let sit in their own steam as they cool (this makes them easier to peel)
3. Peel the eggplant and peppers over the bowl, keeping as much of the juice as possible in the bowl. (it's got a ton of flavor!)
4. Place the roasted vegetables, garlic, vinegar, salt and pepper in a food processor or blender. Blend until a smooth mixture.
5. Drizzle in the olive oil while mixing to blend together into a paste
6. Serve topped with parsley and (optionally) feta cheese.
