*Mix of Najmieh Batmantaglij & Samin Nosrat’s recipes*

* 2 lbs chicken or duck legs without skin
* 1 Tablespoon turmeric
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 large onions, peeled and thinly sliced
* 4 cups pomegranate juice
* &frac14; cup pomegranate molasses
* &frac12; lb shelled walnuts
* &frac12; teaspoon cinnamon
* &frac14; teaspoon ground saffron dissolved in 1 tbsp hot water
* 1 cup peeled and cubed butternut squash (optional)
* 2 Tablespoons sugar

1. Toast the nuts in a 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes, till golden brown.
2. Remove chicken skin and discard or save for another use. In a large bowl, season the chicken with turmeric, 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Set aside.
3. Set a large Dutch oven or similar pot over medium-high heat. When the pot is hot, add oil and carefully lay chicken thighs into the pot in a single layer. It is crucial to leave space between the pieces to allow steam to escape, so brown chicken in batches if necessary. Cook until browned on both sides, flipping halfway through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove chicken from pot and set aside. Add onion to pot with a pinch of salt and cook, stirring regularly, until soft and golden brown, 16 to 18 minutes
4. Roast or brown the squash in a separate pan, if using.
5. In a food processor, grind the cooled walnuts as finely as possible without turning them into a paste. (Alternatively, you can chop the walnuts as finely as possible by hand.) Add 2 cups pomegranate juice and 1/4 cup molasses and the cinnamon to the walnuts and continue blending until you have a very smooth paste.
6. Add the walnut paste and remaining pomegranate juice to the pot. Season with salt and partly cover with a lid. Cook over low heat, stirring frequently, for about 2 hours. If the sauce begins to stick, stir in 1/4 cup water. The sauce will thicken and change color as it cooks, turning a deep, dark brown, similar to mole poblano.
7. Add the saffron, and taste the sauce. Adjust seasoning with salt, pepper and pomegranate molasses as needed. The sauce should be delightfully sweet and sour, so add up to 2 teaspoons sugar, if needed, if it’s too tart.
8. Add the chicken to the sauce and simmer, uncovered, for 45 minutes, or until chicken is falling off the bone. Keep stirring regularly — the sauce should be thick, but not so thick that it sticks to the bottom of the pot, so add a splash of water as needed to prevent burning. Use a large spoon to skim away any walnut oil that has pooled on top of the stew. Taste and adjust seasoning, transfer to a serving dish and garnish with a sprinkling of fresh pomegranate seeds.
