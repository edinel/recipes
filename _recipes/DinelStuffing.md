ingredients:
- "&frac12; lb ground beef"
- "&frac12; lb breakfast sausage"
- "1 &frac14; cup hot water"
- "1 stick butter"
- "&frac14; cup olive oil"
- "2 cups diced celery"
- "&frac34; cup chopped parsley" 
- "2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary"
- "4 teaspoons chopped fresh sage" 
- "&frac34; tsp poultry seasoning"
- "&frac14; tsp tabasco"
- "1 teaspoon kosher salt"
- "2 cans water chestnuts, sliced"
- "1 package Pepperidge Farm Stuffing Cubes"


directions:
- "In a skillet, brown and drain ground beef and sausage.  Leaving the pieces larger will be to your advantage later.  Remove the fat from the pan, then deglaze the pan with the water, scraping up all the fond.  Pour that liquid into a measuring cup and top up till you have 1 &frac14; cups"
- "Meanwhile, in a large stockpot, melt the butter in the olive oil, and sautee celery and parsley until starting to brown."   
- "Add herbs, salt, and tabasco and cook for a few minutes."
- "Stir in stuffing cubes and water.  Cook and stir till the cubes begin to break down and simmer for no more than 30 minutes!  It will try to brown and stick to the pan here.  Keep it moving!"
- "When the turkey is done, add the drippings and juices to the stuffing, and reheat, stirring."

This is THE stuffing that our family has eaten for my entire life.  It's comforting, has good textural contrasts, and is really easy to bring together.
