ingredients:
- "a pinch of hing/asafoetida"
- "One small red onion, diced"
- "&frac14; cup ginger-garlic paste (really about a tablespoon of each and two tablespoons of water)"
- "1 teaspoon kashmiri chili powder"
- "&frac12; tsp turmeric"
- "1 tsp coriander powder"
- "&frac12; tsp amchur (dried mango powder)"
- "1 14-oz can of whole peeled tomatoes"
- "1 Tbsp tomato paste (optional)"
- "2 Tbsp kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves)"
- "1 cinnamon leaf"
- "1 tsp garam masala"
- "1 tsp cumin seed"
- "1 lb whole black urad dal"
- "1/4 lb red kidney beans"

directions:
- Wash urad dal and kidney beans, then brine overnight in 2 quarts of water with 3 tablespoons of kosher salt dissolved into it."
- "Heat oil.  Add pinch of hing and let bloom for 30 seconds."
- "Add a red onion and sauté until beginning to brown."
- "Add ginger-garlic paste and cook for a minute or until just beginning to stick."
- "Add  kashmiri chili, turmeric, coriander powder, amchur and bloom in the hot oil."
- "Add tomatoes, & cinnamon leaf, stirring well to prevent browning.  If you have some tomato paste, add it now"
- "Cook this all together until it starts to pull away from the sides of the pan.  You’ll have around a pint and a half.  You can chill this overnight in the fridge."
- "Drain and add beans to pressure cooker, covering with 2 inches of water.  Add a big pinch of salt."
- "Pressure cook 90 minutes.  When complete, let the pressure reduce naturally (though rapidly releasing won't kill anything)"
- "Remove lid, turn the cooker back on, and add the tomato mixture along with a fat teaspoon of garam masala and cumin seed.  If you want to be motivated, you can bloom this in some hot ghee before adding."
- "Cook and stir till a thick, creamy consistency has been reached."

I made dal!  Without cream!  It turned out well, so I'm writing down what I did. and didn't do.

Best served over rice, with a piece of naan to go with.
