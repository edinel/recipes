tags: dessert, peaches

ingredients:
    - "3 lbs (1360 grams) peeled, pitted, and halved peaches"
    - "&frac14; cup sugar"
    - "&frac14; cup tapioca starch"
    - "1 fat Tablespoon lemon juice"
    - "Scant &frac14; teaspoon cinnamon <br> 
    (or more, if you like a peach-cinnamon cobbler)"
    - "2 drops almond extract (optional)"
    - "1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour less 2 tablespoons 
    (112 grams)"
    - "2 Tablespoons stone-ground cornmeal"
    - "3 Tablespoons granulated sugar"
    - "&frac34; teaspoon baking powder"
    - "&frac14; teaspoon baking soda"
    - "&frac12; teaspoon kosher salt"
    - "Grated zest of one lemon" 
    - "5 Tablespoons (71 grams) unsalted butter cold, cut into 1/4-inch cubes"
    - "&frac13; cup plain whole-milk yogurt"
    - "1 teaspoon granulated or demerara sugar, for sprinkling"
    
directions:
    - "Preheat oven to 425"
    - "Slice each peach half into 4 wedges.  Toss the wedges with 1/4 cup of sugar and let stand for 30 minutes, tossing a few times."
    - "Drain peaches, discarding all but &frac14; of the juice"
    - "Mix juice with a pinch of salt, tapioca starch, lemon juice, cinnamon, and almond extract, and toss with peaches"
    - "Note: The filling can be frozen at this stage and defrosted to bake in the winter, when peaches aren't around"  
    - "Pour into an 8x8 dish and bake until beginning to bubble around the edges, about 15 or 20 minutes"
    - "Meanwhile, make the topping.  Do not start this before beginning the baking or the biscuits won't rise properly"
    - "In a food processor or by hand blend flour, cornmeal, 3 Tablespoons sugar, baking powder, baking soda, lemon zest, and salt to combine"
    - "scatter butter all over and pulse (or rub with your fingertips) until mixture resembles coarse meal" 
    - "Transfer to medium bowl; add yogurt and toss with rubber spatula until cohesive dough is formed. (Don't overmix dough or biscuits will be tough.) Break dough into 6 evenly sized but roughly shaped mounds and set aside."
    - "After peaches are bubbling around the edges, remove peaches from oven and place dough mounds on top, sprinkling with remaining sugar" 
    - "Bake until topping is golden brown and filling is bubbling in the center, 15-20 minutes"

Peach Cobbler is an undefeated summer dessert.  This filling freezes pretty well, so it's a great way to preserve that summer flavor for the wintertime.

Note that making this into a peach-cinnamon cobbler just requires bumping the cinnamon up to a full teaspoon.  Ground ginger is also great with peaches.
