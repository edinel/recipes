title:  "Bucatini all'Amatriciana"
image: "amatriciana.jpg"
tags: pasta, main course, Italian, guanciale, tomato

ingredients:
    - 4 ounces guanciale, sliced very thing (easier if you slice it when it's frozen)
    - 250 grams bucatini or spaghetti.
    - 5 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
    - 1 thinly sliced red onion
    - 2 calabrian chiles
    - 1 cup basic tomato sauce
    - Pecorino Romano cheese

directions:
    - In a large, deep skillet, cook the guanciale over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pancetta to a plate. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the fat in the skillet. Add the onion, garlic and crushed red pepper and cook over moderately high heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion is lightly browned, about 6 minutes. 
    - Return half the guanciale to the skillet. Add the tomato sauce, season with salt and simmer until very thick, about 10 minutes.
    - Meanwhile, in a pot of salted boiling water, cook the pasta until about one minute shy of al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving 1/2 cup of the cooking water.
    - Add the pasta to the sauce along with the parsley and the reserved cooking water and stir over moderately high heat until the pasta is evenly coated, 2 minutes. Serve the pasta in bowls, passing the cheese at the table.

Possibly my favorite pasta there is.  Works great with spaghetti or bucatini; the sauce is rich, porky, garlicky, and a little bit spicy.
