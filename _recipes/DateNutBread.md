title: "Mom's Date Nut bread"
tags: dessert, holiday, quickbread

ingredients:
    - 2 cups pitted, chopped dates
    - 2 cups boiling water
    - 2 tsp baking soda
    - 2 cups sugar
    - "1 stick butter"
    - "2 eggs"
    - "1 Tbsp vanilla"
    - "3 &frac13; cups all-purpose flour (or whole wheat (or a mix))"
    - "2 cups chopped nuts"


directions:
    - Pour the boiling water over the dates and baking soda and allow to cool.
    - Cream together butter and sugar; add eggs and vanilla.
    - Blend the date mixture into the butter-sugar mixture, then add in nuts.
    - Fold in flour. Don't overmix!  But whole wheat flour makes this less of a risk.
    - Bake at 350Â° for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a knife inserted comes out clean.

It doesn't feel like the holidays until the house smells like this recipe baking.  
I like to under-bake it just a little (or let it soak in humidity for a day or two) so the center gets a bit candy-like.  

It's the best!
