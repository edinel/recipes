When I made my own corned beef for the first time it was a revelation.  Can't recommend it strongly enough!  This is the first part of the recipe--where you actually, you know, cure the beef.  After this, it's simmered in water for a couple hours till super-tender, then sliced and served with roasted (preferably) or boiled vegetables for St. Patrick's Day.  Or just boiled for corned beef sandwiches.  Or smoked with a rub for pastrami.  You get the idea!
