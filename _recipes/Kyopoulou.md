title:  "Kyopoulou"
image: "default.jpg"
tags: side, dip, vegetarian, summer, Bulgaria, eggplant, peppers

ingredients:
-  3 eggplants
-  "3-4 ripe tomatoes.  (note: there is an argument amongst families about whether there should be tomatoes in kyopoulou)"
* "5 peppers (a mix of red and green bell is best here, in my opinion)"
* 5 cloves of garlic
* 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* "&frac12; tsp salt"
* Some black pepper
* Handful of Italian parsley leaves, roughly chopped

directions:
* Roast the vegetables &mdash; grilling over a hot fire is the best way to do it.
    * Grill the eggplant over medium heat until tender
    * Grill the peppers over high heat until the skins are blackened all over
    * Briefly char the tomatoes.
* Put the eggplant and peppers in a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let sit in their own steam as they cool (this makes them easier to peel)
* Peel the eggplant and peppers over the bowl, keeping as much of the juice as possible in the bowl. (it's got a ton of flavor!)
* Place the roasted vegetables, garlic, vinegar, salt and pepper in a food processor or blender. Blend until a smooth mixture.
* Drizzle in the olive oil while mixing to blend together into a paste
* Serve topped with parsley and (optionally) feta cheese.

Kyopoulou is one of the most traditional Bulgarian dishes.  I like to serve it as a side dish, with some feta sprinkled over the top, and scoop it with flatbread or crackers.
