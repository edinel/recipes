- "Add buttermilk and stir with a fork just until dough begins to come together."
- "Turn out onto flour-coated work surface; knead until dough just becomes cohesive and bumpy, 12 to 14 turns. (Do not knead until dough is smooth, or bread will be tough.)"
- "Pat dough into a round about 6 inches in diameter and 2 inches high and place on greased or parchment-lined baking sheet or in cast-iron pot, if using. "
- "Cut a cross shape into the top."
- "Bake until golden brown and a skewer inserted into center of loaf comes out clean or internal temperature reaches 180 degrees, 40 to 45 minutes. 
   Remove from oven and brush with melted butter; cool to room temperature, 30 to 40 minutes."

Classic Irish soda bread doesn't have any of the caraway or raisins or the other sometimes random things added to it.  
It's perfect for St Patrick's Day, and really, really, really, really wants butter.
