tags: dessert, apricots, pie

ingredients:
- 5 1/3 oz dried apricots
- 1 1/3 cup boiling water
- 5 Tbsp cornstarch
- 2/3 cup sugar
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 4 egg whites
- 1/2 cup sugar, divided in half
- Whipped cream 


directions:
- Mix together the dried fruit and boiling water and allow to soak for at least 24 hours.
- Do not stir the fruit while it is soaking or you will break it up and destroy the appearance, and do not place it in the icebox during the soaking period. (Chilling would retard the softening of the apricots and it would require several days of soaking before the fruit would be soft enough to use.)
- After this twenty-four hour soaking, you will find that the apricots have absorbed about two-thirds of the water in which they were soaked. Pass the entire mix (water, apricots and all) through a Foley food mill or a fine flour sieve. 
- The apricots should be rubbed through so as not to lose any of the pulp. 
- The skins which are left in the food mill or sieve are not to be used, but the pulp which sticks to the bottom should be scraped off and included in the mix. 
- Hold out enough of this pulp and water mixture to dissolve cornstarch in a slurry.
- Place the balance in a pot and heat with 2/3 cup sugar and salt, and heat over a slow fire.
- While this is coming to a boil, beat the 4 egg whites to stiff peaks with 1/4 cup of sugar.
- When eggs are beaten, add the remaining quarter cup sugar and beat just until dissolved.
- After this has been done turn the fire on full force under the apricot mixture. When it reaches a good boil, add the cornstarch slurry and cook until thick and clear. 
- IMMEDIATELY pour the cooked apricot over the egg whites and fold together easily but well with a whisk.  
- Place the mix while still warm in a par-baked pie shell and allow to cool completely before topping with whipped cream.

Dried Apricot Pie, from Pie Marches On by Monroe Boston Strauss

Among the most flavorful of pies are those made with dried fruits—apricots in particular. Although this type of fruit is becoming more and more popular, there are still many restaurateurs who are either not aware of its advantages or who have the mistaken idea that it is too costly for pies. Most of you are well aware of the deliciousness of dried apricots as a breakfast fruit or stewed fruit dessert, but the use of this fruit in pies has been rather neglected. If, however, you will try the recipes given in this chapter, I am certain you will find something which will exceed your expectations. 

An important thing to remember is that the apricot mixture on the stove must not be thickened until the egg whites have been beaten and placed in the bowl. If the mix on the stove is allowed to stand after it is thickened, it will form a heavy skin, and as a result your finished pie will be full of lumps. On the other hand, if the egg whites are whipped too far ahead, they will become soft when the hot filling is poured over them and will have a tendency to break down. It is important, therefore, that at the time you beat the egg whites the mix on the stove should be at the boiling point, so that it can be thickened immediately and poured over the top of the egg whites. Then in order to obtain a nice smooth filling, you must fold the egg whites and cooked mix together immediately. 

 The crust on which this apricot whip filling is to be placed is also an important part of the pie. The filling is light and very delicate and should, therefore, be placed on a pie shell which has been rolled comparatively thin and baked very crisp. A thick, underbaked shell would detract from the delicacy of the pie, so be sure to use a thin, well-baked shell —preferably baked over the bottom of the tin. 

For still better results, use the rolled-in graham cracker shell described elsewhere (it's basically make flour out of graham cracker crumbs and roll out your pie dough in *that*.
