- 3 ribs celery, finely chopped
- 4 cloves garlic
- 2 T parsley, coarsely chopped

- 1 14-Oz can Italian plum tomatoes with liquid
- 1/4 tsp hot pepper flakes
- 1 cup dry red or white wine
- 2 cups fish stock
- 1 t finely minced lemon peel
- 2 lbs assorted firm, white-fleshed fish, such as sea bass, halibut, pollock, tilefish, and/or ocean perch depending upon region and seasonal availability, cut into 2-inch pieces
- 3/4 lb sea scallops
- 3/4 lb medium shrimp
- 1/2 lb small squid
- 3T finely shredded basil


directions:
- Heat oil in a 12-inch pan or wok.  Get it HOT. 
- Finely chop onions, celery, garlic, carrots.  add them to the pan and saute till lightly brown.
- Add parsley, bay leaf, thyme, and rosemary.  Saute, stirring frequently for 3 or so more minutes.
- Stir in the tomatoes, pepper flakes, salt, and pepper and simmer for 10 minutes until reduced a bit.
- Add the wine, raise the heat to medium-high, and heat for 3-4 minutes more.  Remove and discard the bay leaf.  Puree the sauce in a food processor and return to the saute pan.
- _This is where you could pause if you wanted to._
- When ready to continue, reheat the garlic toasts and your serving bowls or plates in a low oven.
- Add the fish stock to the pureed sauce and heat to a boil over medium heat, 5 minutes.  
- "Now make the toasts:  Place the bread on a baking sheet, brush both sides with olive oil, and toast until golden.  While warm, rub both sides with cut clove of garlic. Wrap in aluminum foil for later warming."
- Stir in the lemon peel and add the pieces of fish, in one layer.  
- Cover and cook gently for 5 minutes.  
- Tuck in the scallops, and distribute the shrimp among the fish.  
- Tilt the pan and, using a baster or spoon, moisten the surface with the sauce.  
- Cover and cook for three more minutes, add the squid, and cook for 1-2 minutes more. 
- The sauce should not be watery but have some body.  Do not stir to avoid breaking up the fish.
- To serve, place a toast in a warmed bowl or plate and ladle equal portions of fish, shellfish, and sauce over the toasts.  Sprinkle with the basil and serve hot.

This is a really good version of cioppino.  I like having some of the base frozen in the freezer at all times.
