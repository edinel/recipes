tags: bread, sourdough, leftovers

ingredients:
    - 15g starter
    - 120g cool water
    - 105g whole wheat flour
    - Then
    - 240g water
    - 175 g bread flour
    - 200 g whole wheat flour
    - 12 g salt
    

directions:
    - Make the pre-ferment.  Measure and mix together 15 grams of starter, 120 grams of water, and 105 grams of whole wheat flour.  Cover and let ferment in a cool place overnight or around 12 hours.

    - Then, make the dough.  
    - Mix all the pre-ferment with the 240 grams of water until well dispersed.
    - Mix with that the remaining flour and salt.  Mix until combined but don't worry too much about kneading at this point.
    - "For the next 2 hours, every 30 minutes, give the dough series of stretch-and-folds:  dip your hand in water, grab the bottom of the dough, fold it over the top.  Turn the bowl about 30 degrees and repeat 6 times."
    - After the two hours, cover and let rise most of the day until doubled in size.
    - "Shape the dough: gently turn it out of the bowl, being careful not to over-deflate it.  Fold it over and stretch, building tension in the top of the dough several times -- without deflating the dough, best you can."
    - Place in a well-floured banetton with a liner and proof overnight in the fridge.
    - Put a dutch oven or combo cooker in the oven and 450 degrees for at least 30 minutes.
    - Carefully turn the bread out into the base of the combo cooker and slash the top *deeply*.  (I like a + most)
    - Cover and bake for 40 minutes, then carefully remove the top (you will get a steam burn) and bake for 10 more minutes to get a really nice brown crust.

I've experimented a ton with baking bread, and this has been the most reliable way that I've found for making sourdougbh for the family week after week
