image: "jamtart.jpg"
tags: dessert, jam, Italian

ingredients:
    - "2 &frac12; cups all-purpose flour"
    - "&frac12; cup sugar"
    - Pinch of salt
    - Zest of 1 lemon
    - 2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
    - 3 large egg yolks
    - "&frac14; cup chilled Vin Santo (traditional Italian wine) or sweet sherry (I like oloroso)"
    - 2 cups jam
    - sliced almonds (optional)
    
directions:
    - "In the bowl of a food  processor, combine flour, sugar, salt, and zest; pulse 2 or 3 times to  mix. Add butter; pulse until mixture resembles coarse meal."
    - "In a small bowl, beat egg yolks  with Vin Santo. With machine running, add to flour mixture; process  until dough comes together and pulls away from sides of bowl, 5 to 6  seconds. Turn dough out onto work surface; shape into disc. Cover with  plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes."
    
    - "Preheat oven to 425  degrees.  In a small bowl, thin the jam with hot water a teaspoon at a time,  stirring until smooth; season with a dash of pepper. Mix well. Set  aside."
    - "Remove dough from refrigerator.  On a lightly floured work surface, roll out dough to a circle 14 inches in diameter. Fit dough into a 12-inch fluted round tart pan with a  removable bottom, pressing gently into sides and bottom, or just roll out and make a lip. Trim excess  pastry by rolling the rolling pin across top if using a pan."
    - "Spread jam mixture over  dough.  Sprinkle on almonds, if using."
    - "Bake until filling is glossy  and dough is deeply golden, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack  and cool for several minutes. Serve warm."

Jam Crostata is a massively under-appreciated way to use jam. Jam quality makes a big difference here, though, so use the best you can.
