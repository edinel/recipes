At first read, this seems like a truly bizarre recipe.  But the lemon juice cuts the sweetness of the raisins, the spices make it super-wintery, and the whipped cream mellows it all out.  It's really quite delicious and unusual these days.

Note that it's also totally reasonable to blind-bake the pie shell first; given the short baking time and low temperature this improves the pie a lot.
