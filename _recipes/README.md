# recipes

This is my porfolio of recipes.  

_TODO:_

    * Now that I've settled (mostly) on chowdown.io as my display tooling, I need to figure out a few additional things relating to it
        - Tag organization and displaying
        - Metadata for each recipe (figure out how to do that -- YAML?  )
        - Figure out if I can do sub-headings   
    * Transfer all the content from Evernote
