title:  "Coq Au Vin"
image: coq-au-vin.jpg
tags: mains, chicken, French

ingredients:
- "1 &frac12; lbs Brown or cremini Mushrooms"
- "&frac12; lb Maitake (hen-of-the-woods) mushrooms"
- 3 large carrots
- A stalk or two of celery
- 3 large onions
- A few sprigs of lemon thyme
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 quarts homemade chicken stock
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1 bottle red wine (pinot or a relatively low-tannin variety is best)
- "&frac12; cup cognac"
- "&frac12; lb bacon, cut into lardons"
- 4 backyard chicken leg quarters
- 4 backyard chicken "airline breasts"
- 1 small bunch parsley

directions:
- Bring the wine to a boil and add a teaspoon or so of kosher salt and the bay leaf.
- Using a lighter, set the wine vapors afire and let cook for a few minutes to burn and boil off some of the alcohol.
- Marinade the chicken overnight in the wine.  
- The next day, render the fat from the lardons.  Save the fat, also save the browned and crispy lardon
- Brown the chicken (in batches) well in the bacon fat.  If they're happy chickens, they'll throw off a lot of chicken fat.  Feel free to remove some from the pan as it goes.
- If they're backyard chickens, the skin should already be removed at slaughter time (to render for fat) but no worries if not--the skin will likely shrink and curl up a lot.  
- Once fully browned, deglaze the pan with the wine from the marinade.  
- Move to your largest dutch oven, add 1/2 the chicken stock and bring to a simmer.
- Meanwhile, wash and quarter the brown mushrooms, and wash and pull apart the hen-of-the-woods.  
- Cut the onions, carrots, and celery into large chunks.
- In a separate pan, while the chicken has begun simmering--cook the mushrooms until they give up their water and begin to brown.  Add the carrots, onions, and a bit of salt and keep browning.
- When everything is just browned around the edges, add the thyme, turn the fire off and add the &frac12; cup of cognac.  Get the lid ready, light it on fire and cook off the alcohol from the cognac.  
- When the flames die down, add the rest of the stock, deglaze and scrape up any and all browned bits from the pan.
- Add to the now-simmering chicken, and stir to combine.  
- Put in a 300 degree oven and cook, covered, until chicken is tender.  For five-year-old backyard chickens, this will literally be about 6 hours.  Keep a careful eye on the liquid level.
- After chicken is tender, remove from liquid.  
- Strain the sauce and separate the fat from the liquid (there will probably be a lot of fat).  
- Remove as many of the mushrooms from the strained bits as you can reasonably do and add back to the chicken.
- Puree the sauce with a blender till smooth, re-add to the chicken and mushrooms, add a bit of water if needed to thin, and keep the whole thing warm until time for service.
- At service, garnish with freshly chopped parsley.  Serve over roasted potatoes.

This is a French classic.  Beware, though, because backyard domestic chickens take a LONG time to become tender -- five or six hours, for real.
