title:  "Orichiette with Rapini, Ricotta, and Sausage"
image: "orichiette-rapini.jpg"
tags: pasta, main course, Italian, Sausage, Rapini, Broccoli Rabe

ingredients:
    - 6 ounces Italian sausage, sweet or hot
    - 1 pound orecchiette
    - 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
    - 2 lbs broccoli rabe, cut into 1-inch pieces
    - 1 cup ricotta cheese (don't use the bad stuff)
    - 1/2 cup grated pecorino Romano cheese
    - A pinch crushed red pepper flakes (optional)

directions:
    - Remove the sausage from its casing and crumble into a large skillet. 
    - Add 2 teaspoons of the olive oil and cook over medium heat, stirring, until the sausage is no longer pink and much of the fat has been rendered.  
    - Scrape the sausage into a sieve and drain off as much fat as possible, then blot on paper towels. Set aside on a plate. Don't wash the pan yet.  
    - In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the orecchiette 2 minutes short of al dente.  This pasta is thicker than most and takes a bit longer to cook. 
    - Scoop out and reserve 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water. Drain the pasta in a colander.
    - In the skillet, cook the garlic in some more olive oil over medium-high heat for 1 to 2 minutes, until fragrant but not brown. 
    - Add the broccoli rabe and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes longer. 
    - Add the reserved pasta cooking water, reduce the heat to medium, cover and cook, stirring once or twice, for 4 to 5 minutes, until the broccoli rabe is tender but not mushy.
    - Add the cooked sausage, the ricotta and the orecchiette. 
    - Stir gently to mix. 
    - Cover, reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook for about 2 minutes, until heated through. 
    - Toss with the pecorino Romano cheese, season with salt and pepper to taste and red pepper flakes, if using, and serve.

It's a classic for a reason.  Using ricotta makes it a bit less dour than pasta, greens, and sausage can sometimes be, though you probably could skimp a bit on the ricotta without major ill effects.
