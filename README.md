# recipes
This is my porfolio of recipes.  


_TODO:_

* Metadata for each recipe (figure out how to do that -- YAML?  )
* Figure out a display option for these recipes (Perhaps an integrated website like chowdown.io?)
* Transfer all the content from Evernote 
* Figure out licensing for the content (Creative commons or whatever)
* do I really want to deal with frickin Ruby to make a website?
